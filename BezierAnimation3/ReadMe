Read me on Blender for Bezier Curve Editor for Processing (language):

You'll want to use the associated beziercurvedatareader3.py script
in Blender.  Select the associated Bezier Curve which should be named
"CurveObj" or modify the script for your associated name on line
3 of the script.

Technically at the moment it is designed in reading 5 curve objects and then sequentially, though you can modify at a given line the reading of curve objects as necessary.  Just run blender script which outputs to a CSV file curve data.  Then run the processing script which will read the csv file.  No need to transfer curve data between the two programs.

Please see my tutorial on Youtube at:

I provide an indepth discussion of using the associated scripts found in this file at the Youtube link above.
